# Report for homework 3. In this exercise I am learning to use Git. 

I begin the exercise by creating an account on github and installing git on my guest os (xubuntu). Command for installing git on xubuntu was sudo apt install git.
After creating an github account and installing git, I wanted to clone my repository which I have just made, so I could access it with xubuntu.
