# Report for homework 3. In this exercise I am learning to use Git. 

I begin the exercise by creating an account on github and installing git on my guest os (xubuntu). Command for installing git on xubuntu was sudo apt install git.
After creating an github account and installing git, I wanted to clone my repository which I have just made, so I could access it with xubuntu.

Before cloning the repository, I added my name and email information on git by using command git config. Now my teammates could look me up on git log.

Now I wanted to clone my repository. On my github account under that repository which I want to clone, is a button "clone or download" which gives and url address.
Then simply I gave command "git clone <my.repo.url>" now I could acces all my github files on xubuntu.
